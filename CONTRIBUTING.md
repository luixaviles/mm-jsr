## Installation

After cloning the repository run:

```
yarn install
```

Then You can run *watch* mode, so Rollup rebuilds the code on each change

```
yarn watch
```

Now You can open `index.html` file, and test changes there.

## Pull Requests, open source, LGPL philosophy

You are obligated by LGPL license to make your changes to the library public,
**even if you are making these changes for private project** (see [#License explanation](./README.md#license-explanation)).

To do so you should:

1. Fork the repository as new public repository
2. Apply changes to Your repository
3. (optionally) Create Pull Request to original repository if Your changes may be useful to others

It would be very nice if Your changes are covered by some reasonable unit tests.
